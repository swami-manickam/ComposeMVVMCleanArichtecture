**Compose-MVVM-CleanArch-Kotlin**

**CryptoCurrency android app to show the coins list and its details using Coinpaprika API.**

**The following diagram shows the structure of this project with 3 layers:**
**1.Ui**
**2.Domain**
**3.Data**

**ui - It uses all the components and classes related to Android Framework. It gets the data from presentation layer and shows on UI. (access all the modules)**
**data - The data layer implements the repository interface that the domain layer defines. This layer provide a single source of truth for data. (Kotlin module that can only access domain module)**
**remote - Handles data interacting with the network. (can only access data module)**
**cache - Handles data interacting with the local storing (Room DB). (can only access data module)**
**domain - The domain layer contains the UseCases that encapsulate a single and very specific task that can be performed. This task is part of the business logic of the application. (Kotlin module that cannot access any other module)**
**presentation - MVVM with ViewModels exposing LiveData that the UI consume. The ViewModel does not know anything about it's consumers. (Android module that can only access domain module)**

`**Technologies & Methodologies which used:**
**MVVM with CleanArchitecture**
**Android Architecture Components**
**ViewModel - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.**
**Room - Used to create room db and store the data.**
**Navigation - Used to navigate between fragments.**
**Compose - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s recommended modern toolkit for building native UI.**
**Coroutines - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously**
**Flow - Flow is used to pass (send) a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously**
**Dependency Injection**
**Hilt - Easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android application.**
**Retrofit - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.**

**The app has the following base packages:**
**app: Contains Application and AppConstant classes**
**database: Models to work with Room database**
**di: Hilt classes to work with Network and Database**
**network: Services and network models**
**repository: Contains all repositories**
**usecase: to reduce the burden of ViewModel classes and reduce code duplication and complexity**
**utils: Utility class**
**presentation: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.**
